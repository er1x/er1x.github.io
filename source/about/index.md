# About

Hi! I'm Emilio. This is my website & blog.

I've been working for a long time in web development (both front-end and back-end), with a strong focus on JavaScript related technologies, since JavaScript is my favourite programming language. I write posts sometimes.

I'm a programmer, not a designer. I always try to make fast, simple and robust software, like this site.

I'm usually full-time employed. You have a question? Feel free to [leave a message](/contact).
